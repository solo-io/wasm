# Hugo Data Directory Overview

Hugo shortcodes can read information from files in the docs/data/ directory.
This is a useful way to enforce consistency across your website.

## Data files used for Gloo's docs
- Solo.yaml
  - **Generated by Makefile**


```make
.PHONY: pass-version-to-hugo
pass-version-to-hugo:
	echo DocsVersion: > data/Solo.yaml
ifeq ($(RELEASE),"true")
	echo DocsVersion: "/$(VERSION)" > data/Solo.yaml
endif
```
