To install the Web Assembly Hub CLI (`wasme`), simply run the following:

```bash
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/wasme/install | sh
export PATH=$HOME/.wasme/bin:$PATH
```

Verify that `wasme` installed correctly:
```bash
wasme --version
```

```
wasme version 0.0.1
```

Great! You're all set to start building filters. If you're just getting started with the Web Assembly Hub, check out the [Getting Started Tutorial]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/tutorial_code/getting_started_1">}})
