## wasme deploy

Deploy an Envoy WASM Filter to the data plane (Envoy proxies).

### Synopsis

Deploys an Envoy WASM Filter to Envoy instances.

You must provide a value for --id which will become the unique ID of the deployed filter. When using --provider=istio, the ID must be a valid Kubernetes resource name.

You must specify --root-id unless a default root id is provided in the image configuration. Use --root-id to select the filter to run if the wasm image contains more than one filter.



### Options

```
      --config string    optional config that will be passed to the filter. accepts an inline string.
  -h, --help             help for deploy
      --id string        unique id for naming the deployed filter. this is used for logging as well as removing the filter. when running wasme deploy istio, this name must be a valid Kubernetes resource name.
      --root-id string   optional root ID used to bind the filter at the Envoy level. this value is normally read from the filter image directly.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands
