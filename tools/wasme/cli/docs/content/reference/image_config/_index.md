This section contains generated reference documentation for the `wasme` Filter Image Config.

A config file is packaged at build time with all Envoy WASM Filter Images with metadata and runtime configuration for Wasme.

These docs describe the contents of the Image Config. See https://github.com/solo-io/wasme/blob/master/example/cpp/runtime-config.json
for an example runtime configuration.
